# simpleupdater
linux bash script to simply update your system, tired of running like "sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade" etc, here you just download the "update.bash" and run it in your terminal by "bash update.bash" :D, includes flatpak, if you do not have flatpak, do "nano update.bash" and remove the flatpak update -y on line 7 :D
