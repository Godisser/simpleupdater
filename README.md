# simpleupdater
Linux Bash script to simply update your system
made on ubuntu

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE FLATPAK, do "nano [thescript].bash" 
and remove "flatpak update -y" on line "7"
or install flatpak

to run the script, use
"bash [thescript].bash"
if it give you an error of not finding the file,
cd ~/Downloads 
^ - might work, depends on where you downloaded it on 
Me personally have it on the "Home"










- if you want you can make a fork of this
- maybe knife
- spoon?
